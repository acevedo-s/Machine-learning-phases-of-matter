# Transfer and confusion deep learning on frustrated spin systems

-- Honey-IsingJ2-AF-ML-T.c runs 400 independent Monte carlo simulations of the J1-J2 Ising model on the honeycomb lattice. It calculates the main thermodynamics and exports both thermodinamics and raw configurations. 

-- Honeycomb_Dense.ipynb  Dense feed forward neural network that makes the classification from Fig.2 in our work. 

-- triangular_dense_correlations.ipynb Dense feed forward neural network that makes the classification from Fig.3 in our work, using both spin configurations and spin correlations.

-- Model_transfer_Honeycomb.ipynb CNN that makes the classification from Fig. 5 in our work. 

-- Model_lattice_transfer_Neel.ipynb CNN that makes the classification from Fig. 8 in our work.
