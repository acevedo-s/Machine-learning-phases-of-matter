# Transfer and confusion deep learning on frustrated spin systems

All the codes uploaded in this repository are available for use and distribute. In either case, please cite our work using  (cita del trabajo).


Codes written by Santiago Acevedo (acevedo-s in Github): 

-- Honey-IsingJ2-AF-ML-T.c runs several independent Monte carlo simulations of the J1-J2 Ising model on the honeycomb lattice. It calculates the main thermodynamics and exports both thermodinamics and raw configurations. 

-- Honeycomb_Dense.ipynb  Dense feed forward neural network that makes the classification from Fig.2 in our work.

-- triangular_dense_correlations.ipynb Dense feed forward neural network that makes the classification from Fig.3 in our work, using both spin configurations and spin correlations.

-- Model_transfer_Honeycomb.ipynb CNN that makes the classification from Fig. 5 in our work. 

-- Model_lattice_transfer_Neel.ipynb CNN that makes the classification from Fig. 8 in our work.
